			I really enjoy the Fitkora workout gloves, I have been working out for over a decade and these gloves have the best grip. They slide easily into your fingers all the while giving you protection from callouses. Fitkora has done a great job not enclosing the whole hand with the glove so your hands don't sweat and smell after working out. These workout gloves are also easy to tag along in your gym bag without taking up space and making your gym bag odorous. Fitkora gloves are competitively priced and good for both sexes and beginners/athletes. I've used traditional workout gloves in the past, even ones with wrist straps and they always seem to be a hassle and smell. The grip on traditional workout gloves is not as good as the Fitkora workout gloves. I highly recommend Fitkora workout gloves and continue to enjoy mine.

			I'm an avid crossfitter and I have the calluses on my hands to prove it, but it is annoying when I have to drop off the bar while dog pull-ups because I tear. This product eliminates that risk and allows me to keep going. Very fast shipping! Everyone in my box had tried them and loves them too!

			I only lift about once a week and these grips are proving to be a good option for me. They give my hands padding where needed and are comfortable enough that I usually forget I have them on.
